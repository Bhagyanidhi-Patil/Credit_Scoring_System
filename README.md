# Credit_Scoring_System
A credit scoring model is the statistical tool widely used by lenders to access the credit worthiness of their potential and existing customers.In this model we will be using various demographic attributes and past repayment behaviour of an individual that can be utilized to predit his or hers probability of default.


The data set variables are:

BAD: 1 = applicant defaulted on loan or seriously delinquent; 0 = applicant paid loan
LOAN: Amount of the loan request
MORTDUE: Amount due on existing mortgage
VALUE: Value of current property
REASON: DebtCon = debt consolidation; HomeImp = home improvement
JOB: Occupational categories
YOJ: Years at present job
DEROG: Number of major derogatory reports
DELINQ: Number of delinquent credit lines
CLAGE: Age of oldest credit line in months
NINQ: Number of recent credit inquiries
CLNO: Number of credit lines
DEBTINC: Debt-to-income ratio

The binary variable BAD will be the target variable in our credit scoring model, while other variables will be used as predictors.
